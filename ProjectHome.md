Curve fitting consists of finding a suitable equation to represent the trend of the examined data. It is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, which has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints.

Fitted curve represents empirical data using a model based on mathematical equations. With the correct model and calculus, one can determine important characteristics of the data, such as the rate of change anywhere on the curve (first derivative), the local minimum and maximum points of the function (zeros of the first derivative), and the area under the curve (integral). The goal of data (or curve) fitting is to find the parameter values that most closely match the data.

No graphing or analysis software can pick a model for the given data but it can only help in differentiating between models. Once a model is picked, one can do a rough assessment of it by plotting the data. A look at the graphed data points and fitted curve can show if the curve is close to the data. If it is not, then the fit has failed, perhaps because the wrong model was chosen.
